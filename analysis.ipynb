    "## Note:\n",
    "The content of this analysis project should be a narrated analysis that asks and answers a predictive question using a classification or regression method taught in the prerequisite course, DSCI 100. For milestone 1, the code and analysis narrative should be contained within a single Jupyter notebook (e.g., .ipynb file), RMarkdown file (e.g., .Rmd file), or Quarto document (e.g., .qmd file). The analysis narrative should be rich, and at the level of the final project from DSCI 100. Either R or Python can be used to do this. The data for the project should be publicly available, and clearly licensed to be shared and used openly on the internet. We strongly suggest you avoid using data sets where authentication is needed for access (e.g., Kaggle) as this adds another layer of complexity when making these projects reproducible.\n",
