In an attempt to create a safe, positive, productive, and happy community, many organizations and developers create a code of conduct for their projects. A code of conduct in a Data Science project informs others of social norms, acceptable behaviour and general etiquette. It is more outward facing than the team work contract discussed above. We recommend Project Include for a comprehensive guide to writing an effective Code of Conduct.

At minimum, we believe that a good/effective code of conduct should include:

A Statement on diversity and inclusivity
Details on expected, and unacceptable behaviour
A list of consequences for unacceptable behaviour
A procedure for reporting and dealing with unacceptable behaviour
