Licenseâ€™s tell others how they may (or may not) use your work. We will learn more about licenses later in the course, and for now we recommend using an MIT license for the project code and a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license for the project report. As long as your group agrees, these can be changed later in the course when you learn more about licenses. If you want to spend some time choosing different licenses now, we can recommend these two websites to help get you started:
