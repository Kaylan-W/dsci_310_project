It is a good practice to include information about how others, outside the core team, can contribute to your project somewhere in your repository. This is typically done as a separate file in the repository called CONTRIBUTING.md. Here are some examples of this file:

Examples:
https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md

https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md

https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
