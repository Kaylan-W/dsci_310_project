## About 
--- 
In this project, we will predict what cultivar a wine was derived from based on its chemical properties.  

The data was sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://doi.org/10.24432/C5PC7J). It contains data about various wines from Italy derived from three different cultivars. Each row represents the chemical and physical properties of a different wine, such as its concentration of alcohol, magnesium level and hue.
